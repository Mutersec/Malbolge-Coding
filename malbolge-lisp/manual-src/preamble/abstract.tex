MalbolgeLISP is the most complex Malbolge Unshackled program to date (2020, 2021). Unlike other Malbolge programs generated by different toolchains (for instance, LAL, HAL or the "pseudo-instruction" language developed by the Nagoya university), MalbolgeLISP can be used to express complex computations (like folds, monads, efficient scans, iteration and point-free programming), while being able to run within reasonable time and resource constrains on mid-end personal computers. The project aims to research not the cryptanalysis aspect of Malbolge, but its suitability for complex appliances, which could be useful for cryptography and intellectual property protection, and it would certainly raise the bar for future Malbolge programs while exploring functional and array programming possibilities using inherently imperative and polymorphism-oriented Malbolge code.
