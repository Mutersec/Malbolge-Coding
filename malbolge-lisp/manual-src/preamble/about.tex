\par Kamila Szewczyk is the author behind MalbolgeLISP and this book. She's a programmer and mathematician interested in functional programming, data compression, esoteric languages, cryptanalysis and reverse-engineering. Her most notable work includes the cryptanalysis of Mersenne Twister and creating an efficient Malbolge-targetting toolchain - simply put, tinkering with \textit{weird} machines. Her work has been recognized by various programming-oriented communities, which she is a respected member of.

\par She started learning to program at the age of 6. Nowadays, her main area of interest is mathematics (specifically, linear algebra, discrete mathematics and calculus) and she treats programming as a hobby. She's a (now retired) chess player and musician.

\par Kamila's love to everything abstract and unexplored used to continuously give her motivation to improve and create amazing and inspiring things. This book is a fruit of it, but due to the circumstances of working on this publication, she'll never feel right about it.
